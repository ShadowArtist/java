/*
 * Creating a thread in Java

There are two ways to create a thread in Java:
1) By extending Thread class.
2) By implementing Runnable interface.

Before we begin with the programs(code) of creating threads, let’s have a look at these methods of Thread class. We have used few of these methods in the example below.

    getName(): It is used for Obtaining a thread’s name
    getPriority(): Obtain a thread’s priority
    isAlive(): Determine if a thread is still running
    join(): Wait for a thread to terminate
    run(): Entry point for the thread
    sleep(): suspend a thread for a period of time
    start(): start a thread by calling its run() method

public class Threadss 


{

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

		
		
		A obj1= new A();
		
		obj1.start();
		
	}

}


class A extends Thread

{

	public void run() {
		System.out.println("My thread is in running state");
	}
	
}
